                <!--Graduated highschool 2017
                Served an LDS mission in mexico for 2 years
                College at the University of Utah for 1 1/5 years till Covid hit
                took a gap year and am now doing a coding bootcamp through the University of Utah prior to going back to school -->
                <p>
                    A few things about me, I graduated highschool from Olympus Highschool in Salt Lake City in 2017. Following my graduation I was able to play rugby that whole summer,
                    which is my favorite sport to play, for the the Utah Lions Rugby club. That August I left for 2 years to serve a LDS mission in Veracruz, Mexico. There I learned of the 
                    culture, taught people and was able to learn the Spanish language. After I returned I started school at the University of Utah with a declared Major of Chemical engineering.
                    I was able to complete about 2 years before Covid hit, when it did I took a leave from school because I wasn't readily available to learn. Now I am involved in the Full Stack
                    Development Bootcamp and have been loving every minute of it. 
                </p>
                <h3>Favorite activities</h3>
                <!-- <li>Playing sports: especially rugby and softball</li>
                <li>being able to spend time with family</li>
                <li>Dirt-biking any and every mountain</li> -->
                <p>
                    Some of my favorite pastimes are being outside whether on hikes or riding motorcycles, one of my favorite places to ride a the moment is 5 mile pass near Eagle Mountain, Utah.
                    I also really enjoy the mountain range between Filmore and Richmond to get lost on my dirtbike. For me family has been a huge part of my life. I have 2 brothers and a sister, all 
                    younger than myself which in some instances has put a lot of responability on my shoulders. I also really enjoy reading anything and everything in between it is a way for me to escape
                    what can often be considered this reality and take a break. Another way I am able to do so is finding hole-in-the-wall restaurants and reviewing them I have a deep love for Mexican food,
                    but will eat almost anything, if not just trying it once.
